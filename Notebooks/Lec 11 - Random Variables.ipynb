    "A random variable is variable that takes on values according to chance. When discussing random variables, we typically describe them in terms of probability distributions. That is, the probability that each value can come out of the random variable. The classic example of this is a die, which can produce the values 1-6 with uniform probability.\n",

    "We typically separate random variables into two different classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Discrete random variables\n",
    "* Continuous random variables\n",
    "\n",
    "How each of these is handled varies, but the principles underlying them remain the same. We can easily see how modeling random variables can come in handy when dealing with finance; financial assets are often expressed as moving according to deterministic and random patterns, with the random patterns being expressed with random variables. To do this we would 'sample' from the random variable at each timestep, then move the financial instrument by that amount. This analysis is used because much of the motion in assets is unexplained using determinstic models.\n",

    "Each random variable follows a **probability distribution**, a function which describes it. The probability distribution assigns probabilities to all possible values of a random variable. For a given random variable $X$, we express the probability that $X$ is equal to a value $x$ as $P(X = x)$. For discrete random variables, we can express $p(x) = P(X = x)$ in shorthand. This is also known as the **probability mass function** (PMF). For continuous random variables we cannot use a PMF, so we must use a **probability density function** (PDF). \n",
    "\n",
    "For each probability distribution function, we also have a **cumulative distribution function** (CDF). This is defined as $P(X \\leq x)$, the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a particular value. The shorthand for the CDF is $F(x) = P(X \\leq x)$. In order to find $F(x)$ in the discrete case, we sum up the values of the PMF for all outcomes less than or equal to $x$. In the continuous case, we use calculus to integrate the PDF over all values up to $x$."

    "## Discrete Random Variables\n",
    "A discrete random variable is one with a countable number of outcomes. Each of these outcomes has a separate probability associated with it. Consider a coin flip or a die roll, some of the most basic uniformly distributed random variables. For the coin flip, there are two possible outcomes, either heads or tails, each with a $1/2$ probability of occurring. Discrete random variables do not always have equal weights for all outcomes. The basic unit of a discrete random variable is its **probability mass function** (PMF), another name for the probability function $p(x)$. The PMF, or probability function, gives a probability, a mass, to each point in the domain of the probability distribution. A probability function has two main properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $0 \\leq p(x) \\leq 1$ because all probabilities are in the interval $[0, 1]$\n",

    "Changing the value of $p$ from $0.50$ to $0.25$ clearly makes our distribution asymmetric. We can extend this idea of stock price moving with a binomial random variable into a framework that we call the Binomial Model of Stock Price Movement. This is used as one of the foundations for option pricing. In the Binomial Model, it is assumed that for any given time period a stock price can move up or down by a value determined by the up or down probabilities. This turns the stock price into the function of a binomial random variable, the magnitude of upward or downward movement, and the initial stock price. We can vary these parameters in order to approximate different stock price distributions."

    "## Continuous Random Variables\n",
    "Continuous random variables differ from discrete random variables in that continuous ones can take infinitely many outcomes. They cannot be counted or described as a list. As such, it means very little when we assign individual probabilities to outcomes. Because there are infinitely many outcomes, the probability of hitting any individual outcome has a probability of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can resolve this issue by instead taking probabilities across ranges of outcomes. This is managed by using calculus, though in order to use our sampling techniques here we do not actually have to use any. With a continuous random variable $P(X = 0)$ is meaningless. Instead we would look for something more like $P(-1 < X < 1)$. For continous random variables, rather than using a PMF, we define a **probability density function** (PDF), $f_X(x)$, such that we can say:\n",
    "$$P(a < X < b) = \\int_a^b f_X(x)dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to our requirement for discrete distributions that all probabilities add to $1$, here we require that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $f_X(x) \\geq 0$ for all values of $X$\n",
    "2. $P(-\\infty < X < \\infty) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_X(x) dx = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that because the probability at an individual point with a continuous distribution is $0$, the probabilities at the endpoints of a range are $0$. Hence, $P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = P(a < X \\leq b) = P(a \\leq X < B) = P(a < X < b)$. If we integrate the PDF across all possibilities, over the total possible range, the value should be $1$."

    "### Normal Distribution\n",
    "The normal distribution is a very common and important distribution in statistics. Many important tests and methods in statistics, and by extension, finance, are based on the assumption of normality. A large part of this is due to the results of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which states that large enough samples of independent trials are normally distributed. The convenience of the normal distribution finds its way into certain algorithmic trading strategies as well. For example, as covered in the [pairs trading](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/introduction-to-pairs-trading) notebook, we can search for stock pairs that are cointegrated, and bet on the direction the spread between them will change based on a normal distribution."

    "In modern portfolio theory, stock returns are generally assumed to follow a normal distribution. One major characteristic of a normal random variable is that a linear combination of two or more normal random variables is another normal random variable. This is useful for considering mean returns and variance of a portfolio of multiple stocks. Up until this point, we have only considered single variable, or univariate, probability distributions. When we want to describe random variables at once, as in the case of observing multiple stocks, we can instead look at a multivariate distribution. A multivariate normal distribution is described entirely by the means of each variable, their variances, and the distinct correlations between each and every pair of variables. This is important when determining characteristics of portfolios because the variance of the overall portfolio depends on both the variances of its securities and the correlations between them.\n",

We standardize a random variable $X$ by subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance, resulting in the standard normal random variable $Z$.\n",

    "Since, the returns are more volatile, our theoretical curve for the returns has a substantially lower peak than the actual values, which makes sense because the returns are not actually normally distributed. This is again due to the kurtosis of the normal distribution. The returns have a kurtosis value of around $5.20$, while the kurtosis of the normal distribution is $3$. A higher kurtosis leads to a higher peak. A major reason why it is so difficult to model prices and returns is due to the underlying probability distributions. A lot of theories and frameworks in finance require that data be somehow related to the normal distribution. This is a major reason for why the normal distribution seems to be so prevalent. For example, the basis of the Black-Scholes pricing model for options assumes that stock prices are log-normally distributed. However, it is exceedingly difficult to find real-world data that fits nicely into the assumptions of normality. When actually implementing a strategy, you should not assume that data follows a distribution that it demonstrably does not unless there is a very good reason for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, when trying to fit a probability distribution to real-world values, we should have a particular distribution (or distributions) in mind. There are a variety of tests for different distributions that we can apply to see what might be the best fit. In additon, as more information becomes available, it will become necessary to update the sample mean and standard deviation or maybe even to find a different distribution to more accurately reflect the new information. The shape of the distribution will change accordingly."
